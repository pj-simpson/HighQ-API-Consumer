                        This simple web application is a demonstration of how to consume HighQ Collaborate's RESTful API.
                        It has been built using the Django framework, which is python based and open source.

                        The imagined use-case is that there are 1st line/ service desk workers, who you
                        want to be able to carry out certain system level tasks, but dont want to expose the full system admin
                        functionality to.
                    </p>
