# HighQ API Consumer

This simple web app has been created by HighQ's support team, using the Django framework in order to demonstrate our RESTful API. 

Broadly speaking, HighQ Collaborate is a file-sharing, process-automation and legal service delivery platform. We provide a RESTful API to give access to most of
the system's modules and functionality. 

## Who is this for?

In support, we get a lot of queries regarding the API endpoints from people in equivalent roles to us. Whilst not necessarily developers, per se,
there are often support, infrastructure, service desk workers, etc ,etc who have a modicum of technical curiosity and want to understand 
what is possible with the APIs we provide. 

## Imagined use case

This app is a basic 'helpdesk' system for a support team divided into 1st and 2nd line workers. It is not desirable to expose the full system admin functionality of
Collaborate to the 1st line staff, but you want them be able to carry out low-level administrative tasks like re-sending site invites, checking on the 
status and size of sites, reporting on when users were added to the system, etc, etc. For tasks which cannot be carried out by them, they can create a helpdesk "ticket"
for the 2nd line team to pick up. The second line team can even 'push' the tickets into their collaborate instance's Tasks modules, meaning each team has a different means
of interacting with their instance, via the API. 

## What next?

If you are familiar with the basics of web development, you might just be curious to peek here at how we've dealt with common web-development
tasks,such as AJAX requests to API endpoints, OAuth Token Generation and others.. 

If you are completely unfamiliar with Django and/or Python I'd recommend working through a few of the tutorials [HERE](https://www.fullstackpython.com/django.html)
and then you can give the following a go: 

1. [Install Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your local machine.
2. Clone or copy this repository. 
3. Create and activate a [virtual environment](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/) in the root folder
4. Use pip to install the [requirements.txt](http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/How-to-create-a-requirements-txt-file-for-a-Django-project.php)
5. Add a [.env file](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/2015/11/26/package-of-the-week-python-decouple.html) with the following details: 
  - HIGHQCLIENTKEY={{client_key}}
  - HIGHQCLIENTSECRET={{secret_key}}
  - HIGHQCODE={{OAuth_Code}}
  - INSTANCE={{Instance_URL}}
6. Create a super-user and log into the admin site
    - Add one group called 'First Line' with the permission: 'tasks | task | can add task , tasks | task | can view task'
    - Add another group called 'Second Line' with the permissions: 'tasks | task | can view task , tasks | task | can change task'
7. Run the application using  "python3 manage.py runserver" and visit: http://localhost:8000/
